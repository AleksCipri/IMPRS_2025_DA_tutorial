    "In the last tutorial, we saw an instance of distance-based and adversarial domain adaptation (DA) techniques working to improve the generalization of a NN trained on MNIST and evaluated on MNIST-M. We will now move to a more physical dataset of galaxy morphologies, with the differences between source and target domain due to fundamentally different imaging devices. We will be using the Sinkhorn divergence as our distance metric for DA. \n",

    "The particular focus here will be playing around with hyperparameters, illustrating the success and failure points of DA and the importance of finding the right sweet-spot for training. We will end with more sophisticated techniques for implementing DA that can automate-away the need for hyperparameter tuning. To that end we will again consider a subset of the full galaxy dataset to simplify the task. We'll start with the same code imports as before:"

There are several principled kernel options (e.g., Gaussian, Laplacian, linear, etc.) with the optimal choice of kernel determined through extensive experimentation. A single kernel may not be optimal, either, and a superposition of kernels may be needed for optimal domain alignment. OT distances avoid this by not requiring a kernel function in computing distances, and have gained popularity in recent years due to *entropic regularization* making the calculation of such distances more manageable.

    "The overall idea is two introduce trainable coefficients for the two loss terms. Let us introduce two trainable scalar parameters $\\eta_1$ and $\\eta_2$, and define the following loss function:\n",

    "\n",
    "These values can then be optimized jointly with the model parameters, avoiding the need for a user-specified weighting for the loss terms.\n",

    "\n",
    "* What happens to each loss term as its corresponding $\\eta_i \\to 0$.\n",
    "* What does the third term $\\log(|\\eta_1 \\eta_2|)$ do?\n",
    "* We saw that strongly preffering $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{DA}$ over $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{CE}$ will result in bad performance, and that we probably want $\\eta_2^{-2} < 2$. This trainable prescription does not know a priori that doing so is bad. Is there any way to enforce this? *Hint*: Think about what range the parameters should be in, initializing them properly and governing their time evolution."
